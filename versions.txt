1 - nonstruct board working with depth first and random.
2 - changed to struct board. works with depth first and random.
3 - last use of pointer in move_agent. depth first works, breadth first seg faults.
4 - change to non-pointer in move_agent. made iterative-dfs and given a cmd line interface.
5 - making checksum functionality.
6 - integrating checksum functionality to breadth first.
6b - fixing node run out issue.
7 - integrating checksum to depth first search.
7b - fixing iterative deepening. (didn't work)
8 - code clean up, removing console prints.
9 - integrating checksum to iterative depth search.
10 - option to omit checksum functionality from breath and depth.
11 - *new heuristic search*
